                            DI Fellows participate in bi-weekly internship prep 
                            workshops, while also receiving mentorship from business 
                            and tech professionals to ultimately become well-rounded prospective interns. 
                            Each workshop will introduce Fellows to new professionals across 
                            various industries to build their professional network.

                        <h2><strong>When and where do workshops take place?</strong><br></h2>
                        Workshops are hosted bi-weekly on Thursday evenings from 6 PM until 8 PM in Midtown Manhattan. 
                        The program lasts from October 17th until May 7th. Fellows must be on time and present for 
                        at least 11 out of the 14 workshops.<br><br>
                          
                        <h2><strong>How much will I have to spend to be a fellow?</strong></h2>
                        You will be spending zero dollars, but important to know that while this program is FREE, 
                        we ask our fellows to pay us with something even more valuable: their time. By showing up to the 
                        workshops with an open mind and commitment to investing in yourself, you will have provided us with 
                        all that we need.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>What kind of workshops will be taught?</strong></h2>
                        Fellows will be taught how to improve their soft and technical skills, as well as gain a 
                        better understanding of what career paths to pursue. We also have a hackathon-type project 
                        our fellows will work on called, Project Synergy. Fellows will develop a product/company, 
                        while integrating the technical skills taught to them through our workshops.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>Am I guaranteed an internship placement?</strong></h2>
                        No. As with anything else in life, you will have to work for it, and we will be there 
                        to help you get there. DI provides fellows with an outstanding support system from mentors, 
                        business/tech professionals, fellows, and board members. It will not be easy, but anything 
                        special is never easy to obtain.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>Who will be conducting the workshops?</strong></h2>
                        Workshops will be conducted by professionals who currently work or have worked in the business 
                        or tech field. Professionals who come to our workshops have years of experience with an 
                        expertise to share.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>Will it always be the same workshop speakers?</strong></h2>
                        Absolutely...not! At each workshop, we bring new professionals for our fellows to connect with. 
                        By doing so, fellows will have significantly grown their network upon completion of the program. 
                        As a fellow, you will be responsible for connecting and building relationships with the professionals 
                        who come to our workshops.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>I earned 30 college credits in high school, 
                        but will have only earned 30 credits in college. Am I still eligible?</strong></h2>
                        Yes! We donâ€™t count college credits earned in high school.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>I transferred from a community college with an Associates degree, but 
                                will be starting my first year at a four year college. Am I considered a freshman who is eligible?</strong></h2>
                        No. Unfortunately, you must be a student who will have no more than 60 credits by the end of Spring 2020. 
                        With an Associates, you will have surpassed that.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>How can I be involved with Diverse Influencers even if Iâ€™m not eligible?</strong></h2>
                        We host an annual event for ALL CUNY students called Meet the Recruiters. Be on the lookout for 
                        more information by following us on LinkedIn! We will see you there.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>I donâ€™t go to CUNY, but Iâ€™m interested in being a fellow. Can you make an exception for me?</strong></h2>
                        We are happy to know you are interested, but our program and all events are for current CUNY students.<br><br>
                            
                        <h2><strong>If I start out as someone wanting to pursue a business-related career, but decide to pursue 
                            a career in tech instead, will that affect my status within the program?</strong></h2>
                        Of course not! We want our fellows to have an open mind when it comes to our program. Regardless of your 
                        intended career path, we want whatâ€™s best for you and will support you no matter what!<br><br>

                                    <h2><strong>When and where do workshops take place?</strong><br></h2>
                                    Workshops are hosted bi-weekly on Thursday evenings from 6 PM until 8 PM in Midtown Manhattan. 
                                    The program lasts from October 17th until May 7th. Fellows must be on time and present for 
                                    at least 11 out of the 14 workshops.<br><br>
                                      
                                    <h2><strong>How much will I have to spend to be a fellow?</strong></h2>
                                    You will be spending zero dollars, but important to know that while this program is FREE, 
                                    we ask our fellows to pay us with something even more valuable: their time. By showing up to the 
                                    workshops with an open mind and commitment to investing in yourself, you will have provided us with 
                                    all that we need.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>What kind of workshops will be taught?</strong></h2>
                                    Fellows will be taught how to improve their soft and technical skills, as well as gain a 
                                    better understanding of what career paths to pursue. We also have a hackathon-type project 
                                    our fellows will work on called, Project Synergy. Fellows will develop a product/company, 
                                    while integrating the technical skills taught to them through our workshops.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>Am I guaranteed an internship placement?</strong></h2>
                                    No. As with anything else in life, you will have to work for it, and we will be there 
                                    to help you get there. DI provides fellows with an outstanding support system from mentors, 
                                    business/tech professionals, fellows, and board members. It will not be easy, but anything 
                                    special is never easy to obtain.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>Who will be conducting the workshops?</strong></h2>
                                    Workshops will be conducted by professionals who currently work or have worked in the business 
                                    or tech field. Professionals who come to our workshops have years of experience with an 
                                    expertise to share.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>Will it always be the same workshop speakers?</strong></h2>
                                    Absolutely...not! At each workshop, we bring new professionals for our fellows to connect with. 
                                    By doing so, fellows will have significantly grown their network upon completion of the program. 
                                    As a fellow, you will be responsible for connecting and building relationships with the professionals 
                                    who come to our workshops.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>I earned 30 college credits in high school, 
                                    but will have only earned 30 credits in college. Am I still eligible?</strong></h2>
                                    Yes! We donâ€™t count college credits earned in high school.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>I transferred from a community college with an Associates degree, but 
                                            will be starting my first year at a four year college. Am I considered a freshman who is eligible?</strong></h2>
                                    No. Unfortunately, you must be a student who will have no more than 60 credits by the end of Spring 2020. 
                                    With an Associates, you will have surpassed that.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>How can I be involved with Diverse Influencers even if Iâ€™m not eligible?</strong></h2>
                                    We host an annual event for ALL CUNY students called Meet the Recruiters. Be on the lookout for 
                                    more information by following us on LinkedIn! We will see you there.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>I donâ€™t go to CUNY, but Iâ€™m interested in being a fellow. Can you make an exception for me?</strong></h2>
                                    We are happy to know you are interested, but our program and all events are for current CUNY students.<br><br>
                                        
                                    <h2><strong>If I start out as someone wanting to pursue a business-related career, but decide to pursue 
                                        a career in tech instead, will that affect my status within the program?</strong></h2>
                                    Of course not! We want our fellows to have an open mind when it comes to our program. Regardless of your 
                                    intended career path, we want whatâ€™s best for you and will support you no matter what!<br><br>
